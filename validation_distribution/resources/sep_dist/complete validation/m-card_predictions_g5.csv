In Arabidopsis, successful pollen-stigma interactions are dependent on rapid recognition of compatible pollen by the stigmatic papillae located on the surface of the pistil and the subsequent regulation of pollen hydration and germination, and followed by the growth of pollen tubes through the stigma surface. Here we have described the function of a novel gene, E6-like 1 (E6L1), that was identified through the analysis of transcriptome datasets, as one of highest expressed genes in the stigma, and furthermore, its expression was largely restricted to the stigma and trichomes. The first E6 gene was initially identified as a highly expressed gene during cotton fiber development, and related E6-like predicted proteins are found throughout the Angiosperms. To date, no orthologous genes have been assigned a biological function. Both the Arabidopsis E6L1 and cotton E6 proteins are predicted to be secreted, and this was confirmed using an E6L1:RFP fusion construct.

To better understand this remarkable stability we transformed naïve E. coli cells with a plasmid carrying an antibiotic-resistance gene and forced them to adapt in a turbidostat environment. We then drew population samples at regular intervals and subjected them to duplex sequencing-a technique specifically designed for identification of low frequency mutations. Variants at 10 sites implicated in plasmid copy number control emerged almost immediately, tracked consistently across the experiment's time points, and faded below detectable frequencies towards the end. This variation crash coincided with the emergence of mutations on the host chromosome. Mathematical modelling of trajectories for adaptive changes affecting plasmid copy number showed that such mutations cannot readily fix or even reach appreciable frequencies. We conclude that there is a strong selection against alterations of copy number even if it can provide a degree of growth advantage. This incentive is likely rooted in the complex interplay between mutated and wild type plasmids constrained within a single cell and underscores the importance of understanding of intracellular plasmid variability.""]",,,

To test this, we performed genome-wide chromosome conformation analyses in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with a haploinsufficient mutation for lamin A/C. Compared with gene-corrected cells, mutant hiPSC-CMs have marked electrophysiological and contractile alterations, with modest gene expression changes. While large-scale changes in chromosomal topology are evident, differences in chromatin compartmentalization are limited to a few hotspots that escape segregation to the nuclear lamina and inactivation during cardiogenesis. These regions exhibit up-regulation of multiple noncardiac genes including <i>CACNA1A</i>, encoding for neuronal P/Q-type calcium channels. Pharmacological inhibition of the resulting current partially mitigates the electrical alterations. However, chromatin compartment changes do not explain most gene expression alterations in mutant hiPSC-CMs. Thus, global errors in chromosomal compartmentation are not the primary pathogenic mechanism in heart failure due to lamin A/C haploinsufficiency.']",,,

We further observed that the LIF gene, which is highly induced upon rapamycin treatment, strengthened interactions with up- and down-stream intergenic regions.

This diversity was in relation to the definition of predisposing cardiac conditions, the type of dental and surgical procedures performed that require IE prophylaxis, the spectrum of compounds used, and the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis. We observed under-prescription of IE prophylaxis in high-risk patients, the overuse of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients not at high risk of IE, and the use of inappropriate drugs.

We show that most short homopolymeric polyleucine transmembrane proteins containing single amino acid substitutions can activate the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor or the erythropoietin receptor in cultured mouse cells, resulting in cell transformation or proliferation. These proteins displayed complex patterns of activity that were markedly affected by seemingly minor sequence differences in the ultra-simple protein itself or in the transmembrane domain of the target receptor, and the effects of these sequence differences are not additive. In addition, specific leucine residues along the length of these proteins are required for activity, and the positions of these required leucines differ based on the identity and position of the central substituted amino acid. Our results suggest that these ultra-simple proteins use a variety of molecular mechanisms to activate the same target and that diversification of transmembrane domain sequences over the course of evolution minimized off-target interactions.']",,,

Conversely, increasing the layer thickness overcomes the light harvesting issue, but at the cost of severe charge recombination effects. Here we demonstrate that to manage light propagation within all-PSCs, a thick bulk-heterojunction film of approximately 350\u2009nm is needed to effectively enhance photo-harvesting in the near-infrared region. To overcome the severe charge recombination in such a thick film, a non-halogenic additive is used to induce a well-ordered micro-structure that inherently suppresses recombination loss.

Here, we describe the emergence of colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, in a strain belonging to the dominant uropathogenic E. coli ST69 lineage. E. coli strain CFSAN061770 was isolated during monitoring of the popular Egyptian raw milk cheese, karish cheese, for the presence of colistin resistance. The complete genome of E. coli strain CFSAN061770 comprises a chromosome of 5,292,297\u202fbp with a G\u202f+\u202fC content of 50.6%. Further, three plasmids named pEGY1-MCR-1, pEGY2 and pEGY3 of 228,947\u202fbp, 103,234\u202fbp and 87,012\u202fbp were detected, respectively. Plasmid pEGY1-MCR-1 belongs to the IncHI2 incompatibility group and carries the colistin resistance mcr-1 gene flanked by two ISApl1 elements and forms a composite transposon. It mediates resistance to aminoglycosides (aadA1 and aadA2), phenicol (cmlA1 and floR), sulfonamides (sul3), and tetracycline (tet(A)), and these loci were found clustered in a multidrug resistant region. Plasmid pEGY3 carries a complex multiple resistance locus (CMR) (aph(3')-Ia, strA, strB, sul2, and bla<sub>TEM-1</sub>) encoding resistance to different classes of antibiotics. Interestingly, the closest plasmids to plasmid pEGY1-MCR-1 detected from the NCBI Blast search belonged to the incompatibility group IncHI2 and were from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Qatar which suggests a dissemination of pEGY1-MCR-1-like plasmids in the Middle East. Most striking, and of great public health concern is that strain CFSAN061770 carries five virulence genes (iss, fimH, iutA, kpsMIII and kpsTIII) which were identified in clinical extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. Besides that, it carries the astA gene, which codes for the enteroaggregative E. coli heat-stable toxin 1 (EAST1).""]",,,
