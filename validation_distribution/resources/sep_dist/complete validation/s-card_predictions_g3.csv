The probable reaction mechanisms are different for the two photoproducts and may involve both the reaction with singlet oxygen generated by the excited substrate or the reaction of the excited substrate with the ground state oxygen molecule. Electronic absorption and IR spectra indicate that both photoproducts are formed as mixtures of syn and anti-rotameric forms. The obtained results indicate an efficient and easy method for the synthesis of molecules with a benzoxazinone structure.""]",,,

In this study, we studied two closely related V. dahliae strains, and found that V991w showed significantly reduced virulence on cotton than V991b. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed various differentially expressed genes between the two strains, with more genes repressed in V991w. The downregulated genes in V991w were involved in production of hydrophobins, melanin, predicted aflatoxin, and membrane proteins, most of which are related to pathogenesis and multidrug resistance. Consistently, melanin production in V991w in vitro was compromised. We next obtained genomic variations between the two strains, demonstrating that transcription factor genes containing fungi specific transcription factor domain and fungal Zn2-Cys6 binuclear cluster domain were enriched in V991w, which might be related to pathogenicity-related genes downregulation. Thus, this study supports a model in which some virulence factors involved in V. dahliae pathogenicity were pre-expressed during in vitro growth before host interaction.']",,,

The shape of L-L interface is deformed to get variable focal length due to electrowetting effect. However, contact angle saturation of the L-L interface is an unavoidable problem which prevents focal length from further changing. Here, we demonstrate an optofluidic lens based on electrowetting liquid piston. The proposed lens has two connected chambers, the piston chamber and the lens chamber to form a closed-loop fluidic system. The electrowetting liquid piston can generate clockwise and counter-clockwise liquid flows, which can make the L-L interface convex and concave. To prove the concept, we fabricate an optofluidic device whose shortest negative and positive focal lengths are ~-17.9\u2009mm and ~18\u2009mm with 5\u2009mm aperture, respectively. The proposed optofluidic lens has large tunable focal length range. Widespread application of such an adaptive lens is foreseeable.']",,,

Our previous studies reported that LGI3 was expressed in adipose tissues, brain and skin, where it served roles as a multifunctional cytokine and pro-inflammatory adipokine. It was hypothesized that LGI3 may be involved in cytokine networks in cancer. The present study aimed to analyze differentially expressed genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and NSCLC cohort data, to evaluate the prognostic role of LGI3. Expression microarray and NSCLC cohort data were statistically analyzed by bioinformatic methods, and protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment and pathway, gene coexpression network (GCN) and prognostic association analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of LGI3 and its receptor a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 22 were significantly decreased in NSCLC tissues. A total of two upregulated genes and 11 downregulated genes in NSCLC tissues were identified as LGI3-regulated genes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis demonstrated that all LGI3-regulated genes that were altered in NSCLC were involved in a protein-protein interaction network cluster. Functional enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and GCN analyses demonstrated the association of these genes with the immune and inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, the tumor necrosis factor pathway, and chemokine and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways. Analysis of NSCLC cohorts revealed that low expression levels of LGI3 was significantly associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC. Analysis of the somatic mutations of the LGI3 gene in NSCLC revealed that the amino acid residues altered in NSCLC included two single nucleotide polymorphism sites and three phylogenetically coevolved amino acid residues. Taken together, these results suggest that LGI3 may be a potential prognostic marker of NSCLC.']",,,

Recent researches have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play key roles in the genesis and progress of glioma. Detection of circRNAs in glioma cells revealed that the expression of circ-ZNF264 was upregulated. At the same time, the expression of miR-4493 was downregulated in glioma cells and had multiple binding sites on the circ-ZNF264 sequence. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that miR-4493 could bind to circ-ZNF264 and apelin specifically. MiR-4493 expression was not changed, but its target gene apelin expression could be significantly upregulated by circ-ZNF264. MiR-4493 could inhibit the expression of circ-ZNF264 and apelin. Biological behaviors of glioma cells were detected; circ-ZNF264 promoted cell proliferation and invasion and inhibited apoptosis. MiR-4493 had the opposite effects and could terminate the above effects of circ-ZNF264. When the expression of apelin was downregulated and that of circ-ZNF264 was upregulated, the changes of the above biological behaviors were not obvious. Therefore, in glioma cells, circ-ZNF264 can inhibit the function of miR-4493 and then upregulate its target gene apelin expression, thus regulating glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. This finding provides more evidence for the role of circRNAs in glioma.']",,,

The attitudes of two classes, Classic Conservatives and Progressives, were consistent with traditional political conservatism and liberalism; the latter endorsed higher support for the theory of mentoring and government spending on mentoring programs. Members of the third class, Religious Outsiders, were highly religious, self-identified as very conservative, and were highly supportive of the theory of mentoring and the use of government funds on mentoring programs. Ad hoc analyses revealed that Religious Outsiders were the most likely to actually participate in mentoring activities.

Cucumber leaf shapes are diverse; however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying leaf shape formation are unknown.

Genetic analysis revealed that a single recessive gene, rl, is responsible for this mutation. A modified MutMap analysis combined linkage mapping identified a single nucleotide polymorphism within a candidate gene, Csa1M537400, as the mutation underlying the trait. Csa1M537400 encodes a PINOID kinase protein involved in auxin transport. Expression of Csa1M537400 was significantly lower in the rl mutant than in wild type, and it displayed higher levels of IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) in several tissues. Treatment of wild-type plants with an auxin transport inhibitor induced the formation of round leaves, similar to those in the rl mutant. Altered expression patterns of several auxin-related genes in the rl mutant suggest that rl plays a key role in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response in cucumber.
