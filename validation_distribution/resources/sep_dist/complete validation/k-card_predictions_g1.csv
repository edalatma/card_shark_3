Indeed, previously we have reported that SYK also regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) production and hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein involved in these diseases. Moreover, SYK hyperactivation occurs in a subset of activated microglia, in dystrophic neurites surrounding Aβ deposits, and in neurons affected by Tau pathology both in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in AD mouse models. SYK activation increases Tau phosphorylation and accumulation, suggesting that SYK could be an attractive target for treating AD. However, the mechanism by which SYK affects Tau pathology is not clear. In this study, using cell biology and biochemical approaches, along with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and ELISAs, we found that SYK inhibition increases autophagic Tau degradation without impacting Tau production. Using neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrate that SYK acts upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of SYK decreases mTOR pathway activation and increases autophagic Tau degradation. Interestingly, chronic SYK inhibition in a tauopathy mouse model profoundly reduced Tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, neuronal and synaptic loss, and also reversed defective autophagy. Our results further suggest that the SYK up-regulation observed in the brains of individuals with AD contributes to defective autophagic clearance leading to the accumulation of pathogenic Tau species. These findings further highlight SYK as a therapeutic target for the treatment of tauopathies and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies associated with defective autophagic clearance.""]"

Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM), Sitodiplosis mosellana, is one of the most serious threats to wheat production worldwide. Conventional gene mapping methods to identify genes require significant amounts of financial support and time. Here, bulked segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq) was applied to profile candidate genes and develop associated markers for OWBM resistance. Previously, we identified a major QTL (QSm.hebau-4A) for OWBM resistance on the long arm of chromosome 4A. In this study, we aimed at screening differentially expressed resistance genes associated with this QTL. Twelve differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained based on BSR-seq and differential expression analyses. Among them, four were confirmed to be associated with OWBM resistance via quantitative reverse transcription PCR, using an additional set of wheat samples subjected to OWBM invasion. One SPI-like gene and one Malectin-like gene were revealed by gene annotation, respectively. Sequencing results confirmed that the four DEGs and the SPI gene had SNP polymorphisms between wheat parents. All these five resistance-related genes for OWBM were located in the same genomic region with QSm.hebau-4A. Furthermore, six new markers developed based on sequences of the five genes were also mapped in the same genomic region using genetic population. These five genes may be the candidate genes for OWBM resistance in Chinese wheat 'Jimai 24' and should be the targets for further positional isolation."", attributes={'Label': 'KEY MESSAGE', 'NlmCategory': 'UNASSIGNED'})]"

The objective of the present study was to investigate three-dimensional (3D) immunoreactivity patterns for 12 individual protein markers for GABA-ergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic as well as glutamatergic signaling. We analyzed the immunoreactivity using optical densities and created a 3D reconstruction of seven postmortem human STNs. Quantitative modeling of the reconstructed 3D immunoreactivity patterns revealed that the applied protein markers show a gradient distribution in the STN. These gradients were predominantly organized along the ventromedial to dorsolateral axis of the STN. The results are of particular interest in view of the theoretical underpinning for surgical targeting, which is based on a tripartite distribution of cognitive, limbic and motor function in the STN.']"

Therefore, delivering existing therapeutic agents to the central nervous system is expected to provide benefits in various diseases. In this study, we investigated whether inhaled central nervous system drugs reached the brain and affected mouse behaviour. Dizocilpine (MK-801), which increases locomotor activity in mice, was mainly used to study this hypothesis. First, we administered MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, to mice via inhalation and examined whether it induced excessive activity similar to that observed after intraperitoneal administration. We also examined the time- and dose-dependency of drug induced changes in mouse behaviour after MK-801 inhalation. Next, we investigated whether inhalation of scopolamine, pentobarbital, and imipramine also affected mouse behaviour. Mice that inhaled MK-801 showed MK-801-induced hyperactivity similar to that observed following intraperitoneal administration. Furthermore, the extent of activity changed in a time- and dose-dependent manner after MK-801 inhalation. Inhalation of pentobarbital, scopolamine, and imipramine also changed mouse behaviour. These results demonstrate that inhalation of MK-801 exerts effects similar to those achieved with intraperitoneal and oral administration in mice. Thus, central nervous system agonists can reach the brain efficiently via inhalation. This finding may facilitate the development of improved therapies for brain disorders.']"

The conventional molecular dynamics simulation can observe only a few binding events even using the fastest supercomputer. Here, we develop 2D gREST/REUS simulation with enhanced flexibility of the ligand and the protein binding site. Simulation (43 μs in total) applied to an inhibitor binding to c-Src kinase covers 100 binding and unbinding events. On the statistically converged free-energy landscapes, we succeed in predicting the X-ray binding structure, including water positions. Furthermore, we characterize hidden semibound poses and transient encounter complexes on the free-energy landscapes. Regulatory residues distant from the catalytic core are responsible for the initial inhibitor uptake and regulation of subsequent bindings, which was unresolved by experiments. Stabilizing/blocking of either the semibound poses or the encounter complexes can be an effective strategy to optimize drug-target residence time.']"

While many studies have focused on determining the modulatory actions of amines on decapod nervous systems, comparatively little is known about the identity of the receptors through which they exert their actions. Here, a crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, tissue-specific transcriptome was used to identify putative amine receptors in the eyestalk, a structure composed largely of the eyestalk ganglia, including the neuroendocrine X-organ-sinus gland system, and retina. Transcripts encoding 17 distinct putative amine receptors, three dopamine (one dopamine 1-like, one dopamine 2-like, and one dopamine/ecdysteroid-like), five octopamine (one alpha-like, three beta-like, and one octopamine/tyramine-like), three serotonin (two type-1-like and one type-7-like), and six histamine (five histamine-gated chloride channel A-like and one histamine-gated chloride channel B-like) were identified in the assembly. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the transcript encoding one predicted type-1-like serotonin receptor with that cloned previously from the P. clarkii nervous system shows the two sequences to be essentially identical, providing increased support for the validity of the transcripts used to deduce the proteins reported here. Reciprocal BLAST and structural/functional domain analyses support the protein family annotations ascribed to the putative P. clarkii receptors. These data represent the first large-scale description of amine receptors from P. clarkii, and as such provide a new resource for initiating gene-based studies of aminergic control of physiology/behavior at the level of receptors in this species.']"

In the current study, our objective was to identify and genetically characterize the stem rust resistance derived from the cultivated emmer accession PI 193883. A recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between the susceptible durum wheat line Rusty and PI 193883 was genotyped and evaluated for reaction to Pgt races TTKSK, TRTTF, and TMLKC. Two QTLs conferring resistance were identified on chromosome arms 2BL (QSr.fcu-2B) and 6AL (QSr.fcu-6A). The stem rust resistance gene (Sr883-2B) underlying QSr.fcu-2B was recessive, and based on its physical location it is located proximal to the Sr9 region. QSr.fcu-6A was located in the Sr13 region, but PI 193883 is known to carry the susceptible haplotype S4 for Sr13, indicating that the gene underlying QSr.fcu-6A (Sr883-6A) is likely a new allele of Sr13 or a gene residing close to Sr13. Three IWGSC scaffold-based simple sequence repeat (SSR) and two SNP-based semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) markers were developed for the Sr883-2B region, and one STARP marker was developed for Sr883-6A.

Much of the associated research has focused on the development of receptors for individual cations or anions, as well as their applications in different areas. Rarely is complexation of the counterions considered. In contrast, ion pair recognition chemistry, emerging from cation and anion coordination chemistry, is a specific research field where co-complexation of both anions and cations, so-called ion pairs, is the center of focus. Systems used for the purpose, known as ion pair receptors, are typically di- or polytopic hosts that contain recognition sites for both cations and anions and which permit the concurrent binding of multiple ions. The field of ion pair recognition has blossomed during the past decades. Several smaller reviews on the topic were published roughly 5 years ago. They provided a summary of synthetic progress and detailed the various limiting ion recognition modes displayed by both acyclic and macrocyclic ion pair receptors known at the time. The present review is designed to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the chemistry of macrocycle-based ion pair receptors. We specifically focus on the relationship between structure and ion pair recognition, as well as applications of ion pair receptors in sensor development, cation and anion extraction, ion transport, and logic gate construction.']"

The current study was established to determine the ethaboxam sensitivity of the plant pathogen P. sojae and investigate the potential for the emergence of fungicide resistance. The EC50 of 112 P. sojae isolates exhibited a unimodal distribution with a mean EC50 for ethaboxam of 0.033µg/mL. Establishing this baseline sensitivity provided critical data for monitoring changes in ethaboxam-sensitivity in field populations. The potential for fungicide resistance was investigated using adaptation on ethaboxam amended V8 agar, which resulted in the isolation of twenty resistant mutants. An assessment of the biological characteristics of the mutants including mycelial growth, sporulation, germination rate and pathogenicity indicated that the resistance risk in P. sojae was low to medium with no cross-resistance between ethaboxam and cymoxanil, metalaxyl, flumorph, and oxathiapiprolin being detected. However, positive cross-resistance was found between ethaboxam and zoxamide for Q8L and I258V but negative cross-resistance for C165Y. Further investigation revealed that the ethaboxam-resistant mutants had point mutations at amino acids Q8L, C165Y, or I258V of their β-tubulin protein sequences. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated transformation experiments confirmed that the Q8L, C165Y, or I258V mutations could confer ethaboxam resistance in P. sojae and that the C165Y mutation induces high levels of resistance. Taken together the results of the study provide essential data for monitoring the emergence of resistance and resistance management strategies for ethaboxam, as well as for improving the design of novel β-tubulin inhibitors for future development.']"

The conservation of aca genes has served as a signpost for the identification of acr genes, but the function of the proteins encoded by these genes has not been investigated. Here we reveal that an acr-associated promoter drives high levels of acr transcription immediately after phage DNA injection and that Aca proteins subsequently repress this transcription. Without Aca activity, this strong transcription is lethal to a phage. Our results demonstrate how sufficient levels of Acr proteins accumulate early in the infection process to inhibit existing CRISPR-Cas complexes in the host cell. They also imply that the conserved role of Aca proteins is to mitigate the deleterious effects of strong constitutive transcription from acr promoters.']"
