In the human brain, synaptic connections define neural circuits, and synaptic deficits account for various neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, harnessing the full power of cerebral organoids for human brain modeling requires the ability to visualize and analyze synapses in cerebral organoids. Previously, we devised an optimized method to generate human cerebral organoids, and showed that optimal organoids express mature-neuron markers, including synaptic proteins and neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. Here, we give evidence for synaptogenesis in cerebral organoids, via microscopical visualization of synapses. We also describe multiple approaches to quantitatively analyze synapses in cerebral organoids. Collectively, our work provides sufficient evidence for the possibility of modeling synaptogenesis and synaptic disorders in cerebral organoids, and may help advance the use of cerebral organoids in molecular neuroscience and studies of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.']",,,

These mechanisms require different interfacial interactions among CRP, RNA, and DNA of varying sequences. The involvement of such a multiplicity of interfaces requires a tight control to ensure the desired phenotype. CRP-dependent promoters can be grouped into three classes. For decades scientists in the field have been puzzled over the differences in mechanisms between class I and II promoters. Using a new crystal structure, IR spectroscopy, and computational analysis, we defined the energy landscapes of WT and 14 mutated CRPs to determine how a homodimeric protein can distinguish nonpalindromic DNA sequences and facilitate communication between residues located in three different activation regions (AR) in CRP that are ∼30 Å apart. We showed that each mutation imparts differential effects on stability among the subunits and domains in CRP. Consequently, the energetic landscapes of subunits and domains are different, and CRP is asymmetric. Hence, the same mutation can exert different effects on ARs in class I or II promoters. The effect of a mutation is transmitted through a network by long-distance communication not necessarily relying on physical contacts between adjacent residues. The mechanism is simply the sum of the consequences of modulating the synchrony of dynamic motions of residues at a distance, leading to differential effects on ARs in different subunits. The computational analysis is applicable to any system and potentially with predictive capability.']",,,

Next, a graphene-RLP conjugate was synthesized for cross-linking with the unmodified, pristine RLP to form an integrated network.

Pestiviruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), rely on uncleaved NS2-3 for virion formation, while its cleavage product, NS3, is selectively active in RNA replication. This dogma was recently challenged by the selection of gain-of-function mutations in NS2 and NS3 which allowed virion formation in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3 in BVDV type 1 (BVDV-1) variants encoding either a ubiquitin (Ubi) (NS2-Ubi-NS3) or an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (NS2-IRES-NS3) between NS2 and NS3. To determine whether the ability to adapt to NS2-3-independent virion morphogenesis is conserved among pestiviruses, we studied the corresponding NS2 and NS3 mutations (2/T444-V and 3/M132-A) in classical swine fever virus (CSFV). We observed that these mutations were capable of restoring low-level NS2-3-independent virion formation only for CSFV NS2-Ubi-NS3. Interestingly, a second NS2 mutation (V439-D), identified by selection, was essential for high-titer virion production. Similar to previous findings for BVDV-1, these mutations in NS2 and NS3 allowed for low-titer virion production only in CSFV NS2-IRES-NS3. For efficient virion morphogenesis, additional exchanges in NS4A (A48-T) and NS5B (D280-G) were required, indicating that these proteins cooperate in NS2-3-independent virion formation. Interestingly, both NS5B mutations, selected independently for NS2-IRES-NS3 variants of BVDV-1 and CSFV, are located in the fingertip region of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, classifying this structural element as a novel determinant for pestiviral NS2-3-independent virion formation. Together, these findings will stimulate further mechanistic studies on the genome packaging of pestiviruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> For <i>Flaviviridae</i> members, the nonstructural proteins are essential for virion formation and thus exert a dual role in RNA replication and virion morphogenesis. However, it remains unclear how these proteins are functionalized for either process. In wild-type pestiviruses, the NS3/4A complex is selectively active in RNA replication, while NS2-3/4A is essential for virion formation. Mutations recently identified in BVDV-1 rendered NS3/4A capable of supporting NS2-3-independent virion morphogenesis. A comparison of NS3/4A complexes incapable/capable of supporting virion morphogenesis revealed that changes in NS3/NS4A surface interactions are decisive for the gain of function. However, so far, the role of the NS2 mutations as well as the accessory mutations additionally required in the NS2-IRES-NS3 virus variant has not been clarified. To unravel the course of genome packaging, the additional sets of mutations obtained for a second pestivirus species (CSFV) are of significant importance to develop mechanistic models for this complex process.']",,,

G-quadruplexes, stable four-stranded non-canonical DNA structures, can change local chromatin organization through the exclusion of nucleosomes. However, the relationship between G-quadruplexes and higher-order genome organization remains unknown. Here, we found that G-quadruplexes are significantly enriched at boundaries of topological associated domains (TADs). Architectural protein occupancy, which plays critical roles in the formation of TADs, was highly correlated with the content of G-quadruplexes at TAD boundaries. Moreover, adjacent boundaries containing G-quadruplexes frequently interacted with each other because of the high enrichment of architectural protein binding sites. Similar to CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites, G-quadruplexes also showed strong insulation ability in the separation of adjacent regions. Additionally, the insulation ability of CTCF binding sites and TAD boundaries was significantly reinforced by G-quadruplexes. Furthermore, G-quadruplex motifs on different strands were associated with the orientation of CTCF binding sites. These findings suggest a potential role for G-quadruplexes in loop extrusion. The enrichment of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) around regulatory elements containing G-quadruplexes led to frequent interactions between regulatory elements containing G-quadruplexes. Intriguingly, more than 99% of G-quadruplexes overlapped with TFBSs. The binding sites of CTCF and cohesin proteins were preferentially located surrounding G-quadruplexes. Accordingly, we proposed a new mechanism of long-distance gene regulation in which G-quadruplexes are involved in distal interactions between enhancers and promoters.']",,,

The biochemical properties of PA also allow interactions with lipids in several subcellular compartments. Based on this feature, PA is involved in the regulation and amplification of many cellular signalling pathways and functions, as well as in membrane rearrangements. Thereby, PA can influence membrane fusion and fission through four main mechanisms: it is a substrate for enzymes producing lipids (lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol) that are involved in fission or fusion; it contributes to membrane rearrangements by generating negative membrane curvature; it interacts with proteins required for membrane fusion and fission; and it activates enzymes whose products are involved in membrane rearrangements. Here, we discuss the biophysical properties of PA in the context of the above four roles of PA in membrane fusion and fission.']",,,

Recently, we showed that C- or N-terminally truncated FurE versions are blocked for endocytosis and surprisingly show modified substrate specificities. Bifluorescence complementation assays and genetic analyses supported the idea that C- and N-termini interact dynamically and through this interaction regulate selective substrate translocation. Here we functionally dissect and define distinct motifs crucial for endocytosis, transport activity, substrate specificity and folding, in both cytosolic termini of FurE. Subsequently, we obtain novel genetic and in silico evidence indicating that the molecular dynamics of specific N- and C-terminal regions exert long-range effects on the gating mechanism responsible for substrate selection, via pH-dependent interactions with other internal cytosolic loops and membrane lipids. Our work shows that expanded cytoplasmic termini, acquired through evolution mostly in eukaryotic transporters, provide novel specific functional roles.']",,,
